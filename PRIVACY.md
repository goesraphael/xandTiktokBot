# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** April 2025

This privacy policy explains how the AI Horror Story Bot ("the App") handles data.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection

The App does not collect, store, or share any personal information about users. It operates fully autonomously, generating and posting content to TikTok and Twitter based on pre-defined prompts using AI models.

## 2. AI Content Generation

All videos, images, text, and voice content are generated using public APIs such as:

- OpenAI (ChatGPT, TTS, DALLÂ·E)
- Google Gemini AI
- Twitter API
- TikTok Content Posting API

These services process data as per their own privacy policies. No personal user input is collected or used by this App.

## 3. Authentication

The App uses API keys and tokens for authentication with third-party platforms. These credentials are securely stored and never exposed publicly. The App does not ask for or handle any end-user login information.

## 4. Analytics

This App does not use cookies, analytics, or tracking tools.

## 5. Changes to this Policy

This privacy policy may be updated if the App functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected in this file on GitHub.

## 6. Contact

If you have any questions or concerns, please open an issue in the GitHub repository or contact the developer directly.
